    <h1>Problem 3</h1>
    <p>Category: Algebra, Geometry, and Combinatorics</p>
    <p>
        How many isosceles triangles are there with positive area whose side lengths are all positive integers and whose longest side has length $2025$?

$$\textbf{(A) } 2025 \qquad\textbf{(B) } 2026 \qquad\textbf{(C) } 3012 \qquad\textbf{(D) } 3037 \qquad\textbf{(E) } 4050$$

    <p><b>Difficulty:</b> 8/100 — This problem is quite easy to approach, however, the casework is a little challenging. The contestant must realize there are two cases.</p>
    <p><b>Core Concepts:</b> The contestant should know how to set up two cases for when the side length of $2025$ is the repeated side or the side opposite to the vertex. Additionally, they must know how to find how many such triangles are satisfactory for each case.</p>
    <p><b>Non-obvious Transitions:</b> Knowing how to deal with the transition from geometry to a combinatoric interpretation.</p>
    <p><b>Techniques:</b> The contestant should know how to establish an inequality and solve it for all possible cases, accounting for overlap between the cases.</p>
    <p><b>Error-prone Steps:</b> Although not an answer choice, it is easy to forget or double-count the equilateral triangle case. </p>
    <p><b>Ideal Time:</b>
    Experienced contestants may take up to $25$ seconds to complete the problem.
    Intermediate contestants may take up to $45$ seconds to complete the problem.
    Beginner contestants may take up to $1.5$ minutes to solve the problem.</p>
