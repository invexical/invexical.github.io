    <h1>Problem 9</h1>
    <p>Category: Algebra</p>
    <p>
       Let $f(x)=100x^3-300x^2+200x$. For how many real numbers $a$ does the graph of $y=f(x-a)$ pass through the point $(1,25)$?

$$\textbf{(A) } 1 \qquad\textbf{(B) } 2 \qquad\textbf{(C) } 3 \qquad\textbf{(D) } 4 \qquad\textbf{(E) } \text{more than } 4$$




    </p>
    <p><b>Difficulty:</b> 51/100 — This is a classic algebra exercise which is also pretty non-trivial, and too hard for problem 9.</p>
    <p><b>Core Concepts:</b> The contestant must be able to apply the transformation of functions ($f(x-a)$ representing a horziontal shift) to an algebraic context. It is important to understand the shape of a graph without drawing it perfectly. Finally, the contestant must determine the number of roots without actually solving the equation.</p>
    <p><b>Non-obvious Transitions:</b> Don't try to solve the complicated equation. Instead, realize that if the target height is lower than the peak but higher than the valley, the graph must cross that height three times (once on the way up, once down, once up again).
        <p>It can be challenging to determine how many roots satisfy the cubic equation without directly solving it. Some contestants may have been inspired to use calculus. Making the observation that the horizontal translation is equivalent to the condition $f(x)=25$ may be quite difficult for a beginner.</p></p>
    <p><b>Techniques:</b> Instead of directly finding the roots, it is necessary to calculate the maximum and minimum, where the graph turns.</p>
    <p><b>Error-prone Steps:</b> Trying to calculate the exact "roots" (intersection points). The numbers are ugly and you don't need them, you only need to know how many there are. </p>
    <p><b>Ideal Time:</b>
    Experienced contestants may take up to $2-3$ minutes to complete the problem.
    Intermediate contestants may take up to $4$ minutes to complete the problem.
    Beginner contestants may take up to $10$ minutes to solve the problem, if solve it at all.</p>
