    <h1>Problem 1</h1>
    <p>Category: Algebra</p>
    <p>
        Andy and Betsy both live in Mathville. Andy leaves Mathville on his bicycle at $1{:}30$ traveling due north at a steady $8$ miles per hour. Betsy leaves on her bicycle from the same point at $2{:}30$, traveling due east at a steady $12$ miles per hour. At what time will they be exactly the same distance from their common starting point?

        $$\textbf{(A) } 3{:}30 \qquad\textbf{(B) } 3{:}45 \qquad\textbf{(C) } 4{:}00 \qquad\textbf{(D) } 4{:}15 \qquad\textbf{(E) } 4{:}30$$

    <p><b>Difficulty:</b> 6/100 — Straightforward and easy to execute.</p>
    <p><b>Core Concepts:</b>The contestant must know how to work with multiple rates at once, and recognize these can be dealt with by subtracting them. However, this is quite standard and does not require much insight to see.</p>
    <p><b>Non-obvious Transitions:</b> Knowing how to encounter the one-hour delay of Betsy may be difficult to work with, however still standard.</p>
    <p><b>Techniques:</b> Applying the $d=rt$ formula.</p>
    <p><b>Error-prone Steps:</b> N/A</p>
    <p><b>Ideal Time:</b>
    Experienced contestants may take up to $30$ seconds to complete the problem.
    Intermediate contestants may take up to $1$ minute to complete the problem.
    Beginner contestants may take up to $2$ minutes to solve the problem.</p>
