    <h1>Problem 2</h1>
    <p>Category: Algebra</p>
    <p>
        A box contains $10$ pounds of a nut mix that is $50$ percent peanuts, $20$ percent cashews, and $30$ percent almonds. A second nut mix containing $20$ percent peanuts, $40$ percent cashews, and $40$ percent almonds is added to the box resulting in a new nut mix that is $40$ percent peanuts. How many pounds of cashews are now in the box?

$$\textbf{(A) } 3.5 \qquad\textbf{(B) } 4 \qquad\textbf{(C) } 4.5 \qquad\textbf{(D) } 5 \qquad\textbf{(E) } 6$$

    <p><b>Difficulty:</b> 5/100 — Even though some contestants misread the problem and computed the wrong value, it is still quite straightforward and easy to approach..</p>
    <p><b>Core Concepts:</b> It may seem daunting to have so much information gigven in the problem, however, much of it is redundant. The contestant must know how to ignore unimportant details. For a beginner, weighted percentages may be difficult to work with.</p>
    <p><b>Non-obvious Transitions:</b> Know how to traverse unimportant details. Know how to solve mixture balancing problems.</p>
    <p><b>Techniques:</b> For a beginner, it may be most effective to set up a linear equation to solve for the number of pounds of the second mixture to include.</p>
    <p><b>Error-prone Steps:</b> Misreading what the problem is asking for, or misreading the percentages. </p>
    <p><b>Ideal Time:</b>
    Experienced contestants may take up to $20$ seconds to complete the problem.
    Intermediate contestants may take up to $30$ seconds to complete the problem.
    Beginner contestants may take up to $1$ minute to solve the problem.</p>
