    <h1>Problem 4</h1>
    <p>Category: Algebra</p>
    <p>
        A team of students is going to compete against a team of teachers in a trivia contest. The total number of students and teachers is $15$. Ash, a cousin of one of the students, wants to join the contest. If Ash plays with the students, the average age on that team will increase from $12$ to $14$. If Ash plays with the teachers, the average age on that team will decrease from $55$ to $52$. How old is Ash?

$$\textbf{(A) } 28 \qquad\textbf{(B) } 29 \qquad\textbf{(C) } 30 \qquad\textbf{(D) } 32 \qquad\textbf{(E) } 33$$

    <p><b>Difficulty:</b> 26/100 — Notably, this problem was one of the most misplaced on the test, stumping many beginner contestants. It is hard to approach, but the computation is fairly easy. The non-traditional part of the problem is that you are not given how many teachers or students there are, making it quite difficult.</p>
    <p><b>Core Concepts:</b> The contestant needs to know how to tackle problems with a change in mean of a sequence of numbers. Additionally, a system of equations must be set up and constructed correctly.</p>
    <p><b>Non-obvious Transitions:</b> The contestant must know how to extract the age from a change in mean. Moreover, it requires some insight in order to set up a successful system of equations to find the number of teachers and students, and finally calculate Ash's age, requiring an observation that is not very standard for early AMC problems.</p>
    <p><b>Techniques:</b> Knowing that the mean is equal to the sum of all of the terms over the number of terms. Realizing that there are three unknowns in the problem, and setting up a system of equations to tackle it.</p>
    <p><b>Error-prone Steps:</b> Setting up the system of equations incorrectly. </p>
    <p><b>Ideal Time:</b>
    Experienced contestants may take up to $1$ minute to complete the problem.
    Intermediate contestants may take up to $2$ minutes to complete the problem.
    Beginner contestants may take up to $3$ minutes to solve the problem, however, many beginner contestants may have not been able to successfully counter it.</p>
