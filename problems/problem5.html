    <h1>Problem 5</h1>
    <p>Category: Algebra</p>
    <p>
       Consider the sequence of positive integers

$$1,2,1,2,3,2,1,2,3,4,3,2,1,2,3,4,5,4,3,2,1,2,3,4,5,6,5,4,3,2,1,2,\dots$$

What is the 2025th term in this sequence?

$$\textbf{(A) } 5 \qquad\textbf{(B) } 15 \qquad\textbf{(C) } 16 \qquad\textbf{(D) } 44 \qquad\textbf{(E) } 45$$


    </p>
    <p><b>Difficulty:</b> 27/100 — The problem is daunting to the causal contestant, and is initially hard to approach. Once a contestant finds the necessary observation, it is still quite easy to make a silly mistake. Participants may still be reocvering from the stark difficulty curve beginning at problem 4.</p>
    <p><b>Core Concepts:</b>The contestant must know how to properly divide a sequence into manageable bits. A little computation ability is required to extract the final answer.</p>
    <p><b>Non-obvious Transitions:</b> An inexperienced contestant may dive straight into the problem and get stuck; it requires insight to realize that the sequence can be divided into different parts. This problem differs heavily from traditional sequence problems on the AMC.</p>
    <p><b>Techniques:</b> Know how to take in a problem one at a time, dividing it into manageable chunks. The formula for either $1+3+5+\cdots+(2n-1)$ or $2+4+6+\cdots+(2n)$ is almost completely required, unless the contestant makes an assumption. </p>
    <p><b>Error-prone Steps:</b> Sillying the final computation and incorrectly believing that there was some overcount. </p>
    <p><b>Ideal Time:</b>
    Experienced contestants may take up to $35$ seconds to complete the problem.
    Intermediate contestants may take up to $1$ minute to complete the problem.
    Beginner contestants may take up to $2-3$ minutes to solve the problem.</p>
