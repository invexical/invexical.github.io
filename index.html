    <h1>About this Guide</h1>
        <p>I've detailed five main points for each problem in this difficulty guide: core ideas, non-obvious transitions, techniques, error-prone steps, and time costs.<br>
        So far, I've only added in the 2025 AMC10s, and I hope that I can add more problems in the future. Obviously, difficulty is subjective and feel free to challenge any comments that you feel are incorrect.<br>
        I noticed the lack of a standardized difficulty metric for past AMC problems, and I hope I can expand to more problems, especially for more underepresented olympiads like USNCO and USAPhO. Students often rely on subjective comments, making study planning inefficient, and I hope with this website I can help contribute to a solution to this problem. <br>
        I've detailed my thought process on why I've picked the difficulty level for every problem, and added tags to each problem so you can find similarly categorized problems.</p>
