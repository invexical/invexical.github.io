            <h1>About this Guide</h1>
            <p>I've detailed five main points for each problem in this difficulty guide: core ideas, non-obvious transitions, techniques, error-prone steps, and time costs.<br>
            So far, I've only added in the 2025 AMC10s, and I hope that I can add more problems in the future. Obviously, difficulty is subjective and feel free to challenge any comments that you feel are incorrect.<br>
            I noticed the lack of a standardized difficulty metric for past AMC problems, and I hope I can expand to more problems, especially for more underepresented olympiads like USNCO and USAPhO. Students often rely on subjective comments, making study planning inefficient, and I hope with this website I can help contribute to a solution to this problem. <br>
            I've detailed my thought process on why I've picked the difficulty level for every problem, and added tags to each problem so you can find similarly categorized problems.</p>

            <h1>Notes on Ideal Time</h1>
            <p>For ideal time categories, we define a beginner as averaging under 90s on AMCs, an intermediate contestant as averaging 90-120 on AMCs, and an experienced contestant as averaging over 120 on AMCs. Additionally, this category should not dictate how fast you solve the problem; rather, it should be a benchmark for how fast you should aim to solve the problem.</p>

            <h1>Credits</h1>
            <p>Thank you to Alexander Gao, Arjun Raman, Ekansh Malhotra, along with many other novice problem-solvers from the Indiana area for aiding me in this project by contributing opinions towards difficulties.<br>
