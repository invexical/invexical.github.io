Andy and Betsy both live in Mathville. Andy leaves Mathville on his bicycle at $1:30$, traveling due north at a steady $8$ miles per hour. Betsy leaves on her bicycle from the same point at $2:30$, traveling due east at a steady $12$ miles per hour. At what time will they be exactly the same distance from their common starting point?

A team of students is going to compete against a team of teachers in a trivia contest. The total number of students and teachers is $15$. Ash, a cousin of one of the students, wants to join the contest. If Ash plays with the students, the average age on that team will increase from $12$ to $14$. If Ash plays with the teachers, the average age on that team will decrease from $55$ to $52$. How old is Ash?

    <h1>About this Guide</h1>
        <p>I've detailed five main points for each problem in this difficulty guide: core ideas, non-obvious transitions, techniques, error-prone steps, and time costs.<br>
        So far, I've only added in the 2025 AMC10s, and I hope that I can add more problems in the future. Obviously, difficulty is subjective and feel free to challenge any comments that you feel are incorrect.<br>
        I noticed the lack of a standardized difficulty metric for past AMC problems, and I hope I can expand to more problems, especially for more underepresented olympiads like USNCO and USAPhO. Students often rely on subjective comments, making study planning inefficient, and I hope with this website I can help contribute to a solution to this problem. <br>
        I've detailed my thought process on why I've picked the difficulty level for every problem, and added tags to each problem so you can find similarly categorized problems.</p>
